# Push_Swap_Guide

A proposition on how to solve 42cursus's project Push_swap !


## Introduction

First of all, I would like to point that the solution i'm going to talk about is based on a guide writen by [EeeUnS](https://github.com/EeeUnS) from üá∞üá∑42seoul. If you'd like to check out their original post, here's a [link](https://eeeuns.github.io/2022/04/15/push-swap/) to it!

Although decyphering the guide using Google Translate gave us some trouble, my push_swap ended up crushing the operation requierement for a ‚úÖ100/100 grade on the mandatory part.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that we won't talk about actual code here. I'm only going to talk about the logic behind the algorithm, what makes it work. It'll be up to you to implement it 


## Preparation

Before we dive into the algorithm, let's make sure we're on the same page. This guide will be focused on the sorting part of the project. We'll ommit anything about argument parsing and the way both stack's data are stored.

If you haven't already, I'd suggest you to work on both of these parts first, aswell as a function for each of the push_swap instuctions available to us (sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr).
